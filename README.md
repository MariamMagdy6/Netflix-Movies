# Netflix-Movies
Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
Project Description:
  In that project, I applied the skills I had learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I pressed "watch next episode" to discover if Netflix's movies were getting shorter over time and which guest stars appeared in the most popular episode of "The Office," using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
I also gained experience in an essential data science skill â€” exploratory data analysis. This allowed me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I created of the data. I pressed play to begin!
